# Setup of co-working desk 
* Date: 2022-05-24

## Context and Problem Statement
I am living in two places at the moment. In my main department I have a home office in place. For the second one I am
sharing it with my girlfriend. She needs a place to learn online and for me, it is an office space mainly. In addition, we
want to use this place to game and for Video editing.

As base, we have normal Desk out of wood from Ikea and two existing chairs in cheaper quality. We use two 
windows laptops and one Macbook. The room we want to build up this co-working desk is in a WG with an extra room, which could
be used also by one of use if we are too noisy (during meetings).

With this ADR we want to decide on a setup fitting to the most of our needs.
