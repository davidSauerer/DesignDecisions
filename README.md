# DesignDecisions
In this repository I work and write down my design decisions for different parts of my life. I will use for this methods
well known in software development and try to use them also on other parts of my life.

## Methodologies
The right methodology will be chosen for the right issue. Here it will be shortly described and how it fits to non IT-Systems.
Also some further reading links are added for a specification and more details.

### Architecture Decision Records
Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is used to document an Architectural Decision (AD). This method could be also used for parts outside
of software development like "How to set up a good home office space". On the end of the day this is the same problem statement as designing
an IT system. For example in both cases others are interested why a specific Decision was taken like this.
